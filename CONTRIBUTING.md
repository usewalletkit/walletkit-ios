## Generation

Part of the SDK is generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project with an [openapi-spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

Running `./generate.sh` will generate the code with the latest OpenAPI spec from [usewalletkit/api](https://github.com/usewalletkit/api). Make sure you install [OpenAPI Generator CLI](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation#homebrew) before generation.

## Distribution

To distribute a new version of the SDK with new changes, follow the steps below:

1. (CocoaPods) Update version number `s.version` in `WalletKit.podspec`.
2. Commit changes and push to the repository, including generated code and any other needed changes.
3. (CocoaPods) Run `pod lib lint` to validate the SDK.
4. Create a tag with `git tag x.y.z` and run `git push origin x.y.z` to push to remote.
5. (CocoaPods) Run `pod spec lint` to validate the podspec.
6. (CocoaPods) Run `pod trunk push` to publish the new version to CocoaPods Trunk. Make sure you are logged in with `pod trunk register` if it's your first time publishing.
7. (CocoaPods) Verify that the new version is published by checking the CocoaPods website or using the `pod search --simple --ios WalletKit` command.
