# WalletKitDemo

This is a demo app for WalletKit, in which you can explore how to sign in / out a user via Firebase and create / display wallets.

## Getting Started

1. Replace `projectID` in `AppDelegate.swift` with your WalletKit Project ID from the WalletKit Dashboard -> API Keys.
2. Make sure you add your Firebase Project ID to the WalletKit Dashboard -> Settings. You can find the Firebase Project ID in the Firebase Console -> Project Settings -> General.
3. Place your `GoogleService-Info.plist` inside the demo project so that the configuration of Firebase can work as expected.
4. Build and run the demo project in Xcode.
